## Jazz Lead Sheet Guidelines

When creating lead sheets, follow these conventions from Learn Jazz Standards:

### What is a Lead Sheet?
A lead sheet is a piece of music that shows a song's melody and chord changes - the basic blueprint that lets musicians play jazz songs. It contains the melody line and basic harmony (chord symbols).

### Key Components
1. **Staff** - Contains the main melody (usually sung or played by horns)
2. **Musical clef, key signature, and time signature**
3. **Chord symbols** - Written above the staff

### Best Practices for Writing Lead Sheets
- Keep it simple and organized
- Mark your sections clearly (A, B, Coda, etc.)
- Keep it on one page if possible
- Ensure chord symbols are clear and notation is readable
- Write melody clearly so players can easily read the notes on the spot

### Chord Symbol Notation Standards
- **Major 7**: Cmaj7 or C triangle (delta)
- **Minor 7**: Cm7 or C-7
- **Dominant 7**: C7
- **Half-diminished** (minor 7 flat 5): Cm7b5 or C circle with line
- **Diminished 7**: Cdim7 or Co7

### Swing vs Straight Time
- For swing songs, write "4/4 swing" at the top rather than notating triplets
- This tells players that eighth notes are to be played in swing time

### Turnarounds and Repeats
- Turnaround chords appear in brackets at the end of the song (bottom right)
- Play turnaround chords when repeating the song
- Don't play the turnaround on the final round - end on the final chord not in brackets

### Extensions and Alterations
- Jazz chord symbols often abbreviate to just '7' (e.g., G-7 or C7)
- Even if the symbol says '7', players have freedom to add extensions (9, 11, 13) and alterations
- This is the beauty of jazz - interpret chords creatively

### Important Note
Jazz is an aural art form. Lead sheets are visual aids, but the music should primarily be learned by ear.
